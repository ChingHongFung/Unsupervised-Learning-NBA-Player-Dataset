# Unsupervised Learning: NBA PLayer Dataset

This is a project looking at a nba player dataset. The objective is to test the performance of different clustering algorithms in grouping NBA players into clusters. It is especially fun as I could combine my ML skills with a personal interest to generate some interesting insights. Data is available via https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats

A supervised learning approach is used where I tested the KMeans, Hierarchical and Mean-shift algorithms using Scikit-Learn and SciPy. Princiapl Component Analysis is also used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature set for clear visualisation fo the data. For the KMeans algorithm, I used an arbitary number of clusters of 10 to see how players would be grouped.
